# Book Buddy

## Description

Book Buddy refactors an existing Google Books API search engine from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. This application provides users with a streamlined way to search for books and sign up for an account that will enable them to save their favorite books and manage their favorites' list. The transition from REST to GraphQL allows for more precise data queries, reducing the amount of unnecessary data transfer and improving the app's responsiveness. The  also allows for donations to help improve the site.
